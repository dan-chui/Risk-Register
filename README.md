# ISO/IEC 27001 Risk Register Project

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the practical application of **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** principles through the creation of a comprehensive **Information Security Risk Register**.

The goal of this project is to showcase an understanding of:
- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) fundamentals  
- ISO 27001 risk assessment and treatment methodology  
- Mapping risks to **Annex A controls** across organizational, people, physical, and technological domains  

The Risk Register is designed around a **small education / tutoring service scenario**, chosen to reflect a realistic, resource-constrained organization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify information security risks across key assets and processes  
- Assess risks using a qualitative **Likelihood × Impact** model  
- Map risks to appropriate **ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls**  
- Demonstrate risk treatment by estimating **residual risk**  
- Produce an audit-ready, portfolio-ready artifact

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Risk Identification
Key assets and processes were identified across five areas:
- Information & data (e.g. student records)
- IT systems & hardware
- Cloud services & applications
- People & human processes
- Physical and environmental assets

Each risk was described using:
> **Threat + Vulnerability + Business Impact**

---

### 2. Risk Assessment
Risks were evaluated using a qualitative scale:

| Factor | Scale |
|------|------|
| Likelihood | 1 (Very Low) → 5 (Very High) |
| Impact | 1 (Minor) → 5 (Critical) |
| Inherent Risk | Likelihood × Impact |

---

### 3. Risk Treatment & Control Mapping
Each risk was mapped to one or more **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A controls**, covering all four control domains:

- **Organizational** (A.5)
- **People** (A.6)
- **Physical** (A.7)
- **Technological** (A.8)

Residual likelihood and impact were estimated after applying controls.

## 🧱 Example Risk Entries

| Asset / Process | Threat | Annex A Control |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| Student records | Data breach / theft | A.8.11 – Data encryption |
| Laptop / PC | Malware introduction | A.8.10 – Use of removable media |
| Printed documents | Unauthorized disclosure | A.7.3 – Securing offices |
| Wi-Fi network | Eavesdropping | A.8.9 – Configuration management |
| Old devices | Data recovery after disposal | A.7.12 – Secure disposal |

## 🔍 Key Takeaways
- Risk management is not purely technical — **people, process, and physical controls matter**
- ISO 27001 emphasizes **traceability**: risks → controls → treatment → improvement
- Even small organizations benefit from structured risk assessment
- This project reflects real-world GRC activities such as documentation, prioritization, and control justification

---

## 🛠 Tools & Standards
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022  
- ISO/IEC 27005 (risk management guidance)  
- Microsoft Excel  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps / Possible Extensions
- Add a **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**
- Introduce **risk acceptance criteria**
- Expand into an **internal audit checklist**
- Integrate with a SOC-focused detection or incident escalation playbook
